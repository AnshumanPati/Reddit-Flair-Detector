# Reddit-Flair-Detector
A Web App based on Python's micro web framework Flask which detects the flair (category) of a post on the subreddit [india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/) by
utilising the power of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

## Working
The user enters the url of the required post. The app takes the url, extracts various features from it (comments, authors, body .etc.)
and tries to predict the flair using them by applying the finalized model.
